 * This sketch reads an analog value from an LDR (light-dependent resistor)
 * connected to the analog pin defined by LDR_PIN, converts it into a
 * percentage representing light intensity, and prints the raw and
 * percentage values to the serial console at 500 ms intervals.
 *
 * The code is intentionally small and clear for educational and prototyping
 * use. It demonstrates analogRead, basic mapping, and serial output.

 * map(). The raw value and percentage are printed to the serial console.
 * The loop then waits 500 ms before repeating.
 *
 * @details
 * - Raw range: 0 (dark) .. 1023 (bright) depending on wiring and divider.
 * - The map() call inverts the percentage so that 0 -> 100% (bright) and
 *   1023 -> 0% (dark) to provide an intuitive "Light: X%" readout.
 *
 * @note Adjust the map() parameters if your voltage divider produces a
 * different range or polarity.
